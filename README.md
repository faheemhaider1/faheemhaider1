# Hi there, I'm Faheem Haider üëã

## About Me

I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer with experience in AWS, Docker, and Digital Ocean. My expertise lies in building robust CI/CD pipelines and ensuring smooth deployments for various projects. I am also deeply interested in the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I have hands-on experience with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, computer vision projects utilizing OpenCV, and CNN architectures.

### üåê Web Development

In addition to my DevOps and AI/ML skills, I'm also proficient in web development. I've worked with a variety of technologies, including:

- **MERN Stack:** I've developed full-stack applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, delivering seamless and dynamic web experiences.

- **Java Spring Boot:** I have experience building robust and scalable Java applications using the Spring Boot framework.

## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### DevOps & Cloud

- [Dockerizing Jira](https://github.com/faheemhaider1/jira.git): In this project, we delved into the essential steps of creating and configuring a PostgreSQL database, including user authentication and password management. We will also explore the setup of local volumes for data storage in both Jira and PostgreSQL within a Docker environment. Finally, we guided  through the creation of a docker-compose.yml file, enabling seamless access to Jira from your local application, facilitating efficient development and testing workflows.
  
- [Dockerizing 2048-game using AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://github.com/faheemhaider1/2048-game.git): In this project, I went through the process of containerizing the classic 2048 game and subsequently deploying it on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the Elastic Beanstalk service. Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the deployment process by managing various underlying services, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, storage, and domain IP configuration, streamlining the setup and allowing you to focus on your application‚Äôs core functionality.

### AI/ML & Computer Vision

- [Sound Sense](git@github.com:AhmedBinYasin/FYP.git): SoundSense, an innovative application that revolutionizes the way we interact with our auditory environment. SoundSense employs advanced technology to capture and analyze sounds from the surrounding environment, utilizing cutting-edge classification algorithms for precise identification. By harnessing the power of edge computing, this groundbreaking system performs real-time sound analysis directly on the device, minimizing latency and maximizing efficiency.
  
- [Drowsiness Detection using OpenCV]: In this project, I developed a Drowsy Eye Detection system. The application utilized real-time webcam footage to monitor the user's eyes. Whenever the user's eyes remained closed for an extended period, an alarming sound was triggered as an alert. This project was implemented using Python and leveraged libraries such as cv2, pandas, numpy, and a CNN model for eye classification.

### Web Development

- [Smart Learner](git@github.com:faheemhaider1/SmartLearner.git): As part of a freelance project with a team of three members, I contributed to the development of SmartLearner‚Äîan enterprise-level application. This comprehensive system included various features related to school management, such as tracking school buses, managing routes, students, teachers, subjects, classes, sections, exams, results, and attendance. The backend of the application was developed using Java Spring Boot, while the frontend was created using React.js.
  
- [School MS](git@github.com:faheemhaider1/SchoolMS.git): Utilized the Spring Boot web framework and integrated cloud computing (AWS) performing CRUD operations and custom query results using MySQL as database. Api Routing and state management was done by Redux-Saga.
